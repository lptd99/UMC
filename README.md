This repository was created to store everything I have created during my time at College.

The folders are abbreviated and in portuguese, in order to be easier for my colleagues to find what theyâ€™d like to use for studying.

Everything in this repo was created from scratch by me and can only be used if given proper credit.

If you want to use it as a base for another project, it's only necessary that you send me a link to it and credit me for being used as a base for it.
